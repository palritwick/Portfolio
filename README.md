// Description: My Web Dev Portfolio üßë‚Äçüíª

Creating a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a rewarding experience that showcased my web development skills. HTML served as the foundation, structuring the content with semantic elements like "header", "section", "navbar", and "footer". I used "nav" for navigation links, ensuring a user-friendly interface, and "img src" and "a href" with target as blank for image presentations to enhance visual appeal.

Incorporating CSS was crucial for styling. I utilized flexbox and grid layouts to create a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. Custom fonts and color schemes were implemented to reflect my personal brand. CSS transitions and animations were used to add interactive elements, such as hover effects on buttons and smooth scrolling for a polished user experience.

JavaScript brought dynamic functionality to the site. I employed it to create a responsive navigation menu that toggles in mobile view. Additionally, I integrated a form validation script to ensure users submit complete and correct information. JavaScript was also used to implement a lightbox feature for displaying my project images in an overlay, enhancing user engagement.

Overall, my proficiency in HTML structured the content effectively, CSS styled it attractively, and JavaScript added interactive elements, culminating in a professional and engaging portfolio website.
